        - Safety was the major concern cited throughout this survey. While some people identified that there is no safe way to travel from their neighborhood into downtown, many more specifics were given around the opportunities for increasing safety for non-drivers. Some specific examples of both challenges and solutions worth sharing:
            - Cars are regularly driving in the bike lanes.
            - Confusing signage for both drivers and cyclists.
            - Lack of a safe-streets mindset within the city and law enforcement. Many people mentioned an interest in having police patrolling areas where there are bike lanes to ensure that cars are stopping at stop signs, that cars arenâ€™t parked in the lanes that people are biking in, and that pedestrians and cyclists are safe generally.
            - More sidewalks and crosswalks are needed across the city with timed passage periods to increase walkability.
            - Protected bike lanes were mentioned repeatedly. One respondent shared that a painted line is not going to make people feel safer.
        - Convenience is high on the minds of community members in terms of getting to work on time, being able to pick up sick children at school, and after-work commitments.
        - A handful of people indicated an interest in public transportation, including buses and trolleys.
        - People are interested in a dedicated bike path where they felt connected to nature to commute on.
        - One respondent identified the need to have public bathrooms available if we are trying to encourage a walking culture in the downtown area.
